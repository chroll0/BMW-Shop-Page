          which allow you to expand your driving skills as you wish. No matter
          which course you opt for – whether summer or winter – you are

        <h3>ULTIMATE EXPRESSIVE STYLE</h3>
        <p>
          Unmissable, irresistible, unconventional: Its powerful presence and a
          unique design language make the first BMW XM an exceptional phenomenon
          on the roads of the world. The first electrified high-performance
          automobile from BMW M GmbH fascinates with its extrovert appearance as
          much as with its innovative, 480 kW (653 hp) M HYBRID drive.
          Additional options for expressing both the unmistakable character of
          the BMW XM and the personal style of its owner are opened up by the
          special paintwork from BMW Individual which are available from August
          2023.

            The BMW 3.0 CSL is a limited-run special edition built to pay homage
            to the classic 3.0 CSL from the 1970s. It gets the same 3.0 - litre
            twin-turbocharged straight-six from the M4, only it makes an extra
            10hp giving it 560hp overall.

            The next BMW M8 could be fully electric using BMW’s next generation
            platform. In theory, this means it could have up to 1,360hp and four
            electric motors. These exclusive renders give you an idea of what
            this new car will look like, taking heavy inspiration from the i
            Vision Dee concept car.
