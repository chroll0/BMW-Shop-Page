        <h3>BMW DRIVING EXPERIENCE</h3>
        <p>
          The BMW Driving Experience offers a wide range of training variants,
          which allow you to expand your driving skills as you wish. No matter
          which course you opt for – whether summer or winter – you are
          guaranteed driving pleasure and action.

        <h3>ULTIMATE EXPRESSIVE STYLE</h3>
        <p>
          Unmissable, irresistible, unconventional: Its powerful presence and a
          unique design language make the first BMW XM an exceptional phenomenon
          on the roads of the world. The first electrified high-performance
          automobile from BMW M GmbH fascinates with its extrovert appearance as
          much as with its innovative, 480 kW (653 hp) M HYBRID drive.
          Additional options for expressing both the unmistakable character of
          the BMW XM and the personal style of its owner are opened up by the
          special paintwork from BMW Individual which are available from August
          2023.
